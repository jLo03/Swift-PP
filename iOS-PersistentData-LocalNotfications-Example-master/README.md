# iOS Persistent Data & Local Notifications Tutorial
An Example of How to Use Local Notifications and Persistent Data on iOS (Assignment for ICS4U)
This is an assignment for my Grade 12 Computer Science course

This is an XCode Project for a barebones iOS Reminders App, which shows how to use Persistent Data and Local Notifications on iOS.

The app was developed on XCode 7 using Swift 2.2.

The code is not commented very well, so if you want a full explanation of the code in the project, watch the (tediously long) video tutorial on [YouTube here!](https://youtu.be/mPEpftH4Bmc)
